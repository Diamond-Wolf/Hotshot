Building is handled through Premake, and as far as I have tested shouldn't have too many issues.

First, you need to install Premake 5; you can get the from https://premake.github.io. You also need SDL2, FluidSynth, and OpenAL Soft. Find the folder these are located in; specifically, you want the folder for the correct version, which contains the include and lib folders.

Once you have all dependencies located, run Premake:

premake5 <action> --sdl2-path=<SDL2 path> --openal-path=<OpenAL path> --fluidsynth-path=<FluidSynth path>

Action is one of the actions specified at https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake. Hotshot has been tested with gmake2 on Mac and vs2022 on Windows.
Additional options are available:
 --build-network builds network support (untested)
 
After running Premake, navigate to the build directory. Run make to build both games in debug configuration. You can also specify config=release for an optimized release build.
