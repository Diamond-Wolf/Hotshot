Building is handled through Premake, and as far as I have tested shouldn't have too many issues.

First, you need to install Premake 5; you can get the from https://premake.github.io. You also need SDL2, FluidSynth, and OpenAL. Find the folder these are located in; specifically, you want the folder for the correct version, which contains the include and lib folders.

Once you have all dependencies located, run Premake:

premake5 --sdl2-path=<SDL2 path> --openal-path=<OpenAL path> --fluidsynth-path=<FluidSynth path>

Additional options are available:
 --build-editor builds the Miner editor (untested)
 --build-network builds network support (untested)
 --texmap=<map> changes the texmapper configuration according to the following values of <map>:
	descent1 - build both games with Descent 1 texmapper
	descent2 - build both games with Descent 2 texmapper
	original - build both games with their original texmapper
	swap     - build both games with the other game's texmapper

After running Premake, navigate to the build directory. Run make to build both games in debug configuration. You can also specify config=release for an optimized release build, or independently make Hotshot-1 or Hotshot-2 to build just one game.
