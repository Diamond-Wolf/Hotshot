Building is handled through Premake, and as far as I have tested shouldn't have too many issues.

First, you need to install Premake 5; you can get the from https://premake.github.io. You also need SDL3.
Find the folder these are located in; specifically, you want the folder for the correct version, which
contains the include and lib folders. On Mac, this is based on the dylib; the framework will not be
structured correctly.

Once you have all dependencies located, run Premake:

premake5 <action> --sdl-path=<SDL3 path>

Action is one of the actions specified at https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake. Hotshot has been
tested with gmake2 on Mac and vs2022 on Windows.
Additional options are available:
 --build-network builds network support (broken)
 
Using Make: After running Premake, navigate to the build directory. Run make to build both games in debug
configuration. You can also specify config=release for an optimized release build.

See platform_notes.txt for further info.
