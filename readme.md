## Hotshot

An upgraded version of Chocolate Descent

Building:
See building.txt for details. The project has been successfully built on 
Windows using Visual Studio 2022 and macOS with GNU make and clang.

Running:
Hotshot needs game data to run. At the moment, Hotshot will only work with
HOG and PIG files from Descent's PC commercial release, versions 1.4 or 1.5,
as well as Descent 2's commercial release (PC or Mac) version 1.2. Support
for the Descent 2 Interactive Demo is untested.
